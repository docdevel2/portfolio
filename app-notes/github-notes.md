# GitHub Notes
## Description 
About GitHub: The complete developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software.

GitHub runs on Git. What is Git? Git is a version-control system created by programming icon, Linus Torvald. He originally created Git to track changes to source code changes as he was developing the Linux operating system. Git helps programmers collaborate, coordinate work, and work together on complex code and development projects.
(Source: Ref. 1)

My conclusion: GitHub is an online extension of Git that allows multiple developers to collaborate.

## Free account 
* Best place to start, 
* Install Git
* Sign up for free account 
* To do anything in GitHub, youʼll need to know how to first start a repository. A repository (or repo) is essentially synonymous with the word “project.”

## Install Git
* Objective: Study basic Git operations.
* Initially practice revision control using markdown documents that I’m currently editing.

## Why use Git?
* Get access to unlimited public and private repositories
* Get bug tracking and project management
* Publish & consume packages
* Your GitHub Profile is a great place for recruiters to find you and reach out about potential jobs and projects. Many people strive to gain GitHub followers by writing engaging and helpful blog posts, or even by creating podcasts or YouTube GitHub tutorials.

## Stage
The git add command is used to add file contents to the Index (Staging Area). This command updates the current content of the working tree to the staging area. It also prepares the staged content for the next commit. 

“git add” is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”.
