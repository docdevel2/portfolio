I've generated these notes as preparation to respond to a post for a freelance technical writer to write a 1500-2000 word article on GitHub's authorization model.

* OAuth2 scope in JWT

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is 

## Authorization
authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to

## Authentication vs. Authorization
While often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions. In this article, we compare and contrast the two to show how they protect applications in complementary ways. [99]

## OAuth2 scope
OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to
approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

Open Authorization is a process through which an application or website can access private data from another website.

Facebook's Graph API only supports OAuth 2.0. Google supports OAuth 2.0 as the recommended authorization mechanism for all of its APIs.[23] Microsoft also supports OAuth 2.0 for various APIs and its Azure Active Directory service, which is used to secure many Microsoft and third party APIs. [3]
