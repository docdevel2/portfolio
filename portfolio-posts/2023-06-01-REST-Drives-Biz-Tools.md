## Abstract  
As businesses rapidly embrace network-based applications, APIs have become a key component that connects these applications to web services. Many web services are adopting the REST API design style in combination with the open standard OAuth 2 authorization protocol for security. Using a CRM application as an example, this article describes how REST and OAuth 2 enable business applications.  

Keywords: REST API, CRM, HubSpot CRM, Network-base API, Python
