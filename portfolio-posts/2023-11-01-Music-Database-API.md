## Abstract  
If you are a developer who wants to integrate network-based services into your applications, an application programming interface (API) is a frequently used solution. An API allows your client application to interact with a server using a common interface. Network-base APIs are becoming increasingly popular for web applications in industries such as banking, e-commerce, internet of things (IoT), and music. In this article, you will see how you can access a RESTful API database with Python.  

Keywords: REST API, Music API, Music database, Network-base API, Python
