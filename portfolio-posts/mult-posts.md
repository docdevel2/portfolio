title: "SQL Database Migration"  
date: 2023-01-01

## Abstract  
In this article, I show you how I used a Python application programming interface (API) to migrate my music library from a SQL relational database to a NoSQL document database. Using the Python X DevAPI in the MySQL Shell application, I highlight some basics about document databases, the Python methods used, and the database tool that enables migration. Readers who should get the most out of this article are those that have some basic familiarity with the structured query language (SQL) and with the Python programming language.

Keywords: MySQL, X DevAPI, Python, SQL, NoSQL, database

## Abstract  
As businesses rapidly embrace network-based applications, APIs have become a key component that connects these applications to web services. Many web services are adopting the REST API design style in combination with the open standard OAuth 2 authorization protocol for security. Using a CRM application as an example, this article describes how REST and OAuth 2 enable business applications.

## Abstract  
If you are a developer who wants to integrate network-based services into your applications, an application programming interface (API) is a frequently used solution. An API allows your client application to interact with a server using a common interface. Network-base APIs are becoming increasingly popular for web applications in industries such as banking, e-commerce, internet of things (IoT), and music. In this article, you will see how you can access a RESTful API database with Python.  

Keywords: REST API, Music API, Music database, Network-base API, Python
