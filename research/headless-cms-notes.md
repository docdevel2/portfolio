# Headless CMS Notes

Headless CMS is a content management system that allows you to manage content and access it from your applications using an API.

Unlike traditional CMS solutions, headless CMS does without the presentation layer (the “head”) that would dictate how the content should be displayed. Instead, you control the presentation completely with your own code.

Headless architecture allows CMS vendors to provide a true multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) product and look after the CMS for you
while you focus on your applications. So the cloud-first headless CMS combines omnichannel content management and agile delivery within the comfort of a true cloud service.
