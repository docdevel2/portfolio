# Writing Research Methodology
### **(Draft)**

## Overview 
This document describes the methods that I use to research technical writing topics.

## Goals
Research using only credible sources:
	* Standards organizations 
		* Python Software Foundation 
		* MySQL
		* W3C
		* JSON

> Industry standards, and their corresponding specifications, provide a credible source of technical information. These sources are widely accepted and used in developmental and commercial applications. Standards allow developers to potentially leverage an existing infrastructure of  development tools and libraries. As a result, developers can save time and money, while reducing the risks associated with unproven technologies.  

	* Industry leading companies 
		* Oracle (MySQL)
		* RapidAPI 
		* MongoDB

> Industry leaders are a good source of credible information because they demonstrate the viability of a technology. Others in their field will take comfort in the technology .  

> Examples:  
	1. Apple using XML as the third party data exchange format for music metadata. (Give some history. Related standards organization.)
	2. JSON?? (Org: ?)
	3. REST?? (Org: ?)
	4. HTTP?? (Org: W3C)
	5. OAuth?? (Org: ?)
	6. TBD

	* Trade publications 
		* CNET
		* Linux Magazine 
		* PC Magazine 
		* Wired

> Trade publications educate and raise the awareness of technologies.   

	* Educational institutions 
		* UC Berkeley 
	* Research organizations 
		* Dataquest (market data)

## Methodology 
* Select topic 
* Define objective 
* Define audience 
* Research using credible resources as characterized above
* Outline: define subtopics 
* Expand outline in rough draft
	* Incorporate research materials 
	* Specify references 
* Iterate through editing-proofread cycle 

## Technology Standards & Specifications Sources
1. [W3C Standards FAQ](https://www.w3.org/standards/faq.html) The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes documents that define Web technologies. These documents follow a  [process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/tr)  designed to promote consensus, fairness, public accountability, and quality. At the end of this process, W3C publishes  [Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/tr-date-stds.html) , which are considered Web standards.
2. ITU
3. ISO
4. ANSI 
5. NIST
6. Ecma International 
7. IEC
8. JEDEC

## RDF
Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general framework for representing interconnected data on the web. RDF statements are used for describing and exchanging metadata, which enables standardized exchange of data based on relationships. RDF is used to integrate data from multiple sources.

## Web Standards & Protocols
	1.	HTTP
	2.	URI
	3.	URL
	4.	REST 
	5.	CSS
	6.	HTML
	7.	XML
	8.	DOM
	9.	SVG
	10.	WAI-ARIA: 

## IETF RFC
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

A Request for Comments (RFC) is a formal document from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
